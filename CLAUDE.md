# The N.O.V.A. Challenge

**A Game of Collective Creativity & Vision**

## Project Overview

The N.O.V.A. Challenge is a web-based interactive card game designed to foster business creativity and vision development. Players draw cards from four themed decks to build and refine business ideas collaboratively.

## Game Mechanics

### Four Core Zones

2. **ðŸŒ¿ Nurture Zone** - Add context and backstory to develop the concept
3. **âš¡ Optimize Zone** - Enhance and streamline the idea for impact
4. **ðŸŽ¨ Visualize Zone** - Create tangible representations and marketing concepts

### Gameplay Flow

1. Players click on each zone's deck to draw cards sequentially
2. Each drawn card provides prompts or concepts for that phase
3. Once all four cards are drawn, the **Amplify Zone** appears
4. Players synthesize their cards into a cohesive business vision
5. Submit the vision to see a summary of the complete concept
