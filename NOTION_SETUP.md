### 2. Create Notion Database

1. **Create a new page** in your Notion workspace
2. **Add a database** (Table view)

3. **Search for and select** your integration: `Barbuda Rising Vision Collector`
4. **Make sure it has "Full access"**
5. **Copy the Database ID** from the URL:
   - URL looks like: `https://notion.so/your-workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...`
   - Database ID is the 32-character string (like: `12345678901234567890123456789012`)

### 4. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

   - **Name**: `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`
   - **Value**: `12345678901234567890123456789012` (your database ID)
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development

5. **Redeploy your project** for environment variables to take effect

### 5. Test the Integration
